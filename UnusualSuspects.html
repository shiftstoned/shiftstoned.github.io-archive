        </subhead> <h2g>You learn to expect the unexpected from Kaelos. On her <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/kaelosthereckoning" target="_blank">daily stream</a> and during <a href="https://eternalwarcry.com/tournaments/details/UaEELBHck3Q/ets-2018-s3w1-top-8" target="_blank">competitive <strong>Eternal </strong>events</a>, she plays her own brand of&nbsp; decks that often defy convention.<br />
        <br />
        Although she is known for experimentation, her tournament victories have proven that she can also be a real competitive threat.<br />
        <br />
        Most recently, she has been spotted spearheading the launch of <a href="https://theeternalpost.com/" target="_blank">The Eternal Post</a>, a new content&nbsp; source for Eternal players.<pg><h1g>On your feet, wanderer<br />
        <span style="font-family: &quot;Open Sans&quot;, &quot;Courier New&quot;, &quot;DejaVu Sans Mono&quot;, &quot;Bitstream Vera Sans Mono&quot;, monospace; font-size: 18px;">Bring that brain back</span></h1g><br />
        <iq><strong>Shiftstoned:</strong><br />
        Kaelos, the <a href="https://eternalwarcry.com/decks?c=kaelos" target="_blank">decks you construct</a> are often surprising, unique and unexpected. What motivates and inspires you when deckbuilding?</iq><br />
        <br />
        <span style="font-weight: bolder;">Kaelos:</span><br />
        In my former life I was a scientist. When I got sick and lost a lot of my cognitive abilities (like reading), I discovered it wasn&rsquo;t being smart that made me a scientist&mdash;it was being curious and undeterred by failure.<br />
        <br />
        I was a workaholic stuck in a bed, and when I started playing&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bolder;">Eternal</span>&hellip;it was a complex and interesting enough system that I could science it. It was a way to do something I missed and needed.&nbsp;<br />
        <br />
        Looking for novel card interactions and synergies is a huge facet of that, and one that points me toward other questions of mechanics, game design, and player behavior.<br />
        <br />
        <a href="images/kaelos_schedule.png" target="_blank"><img alt="Image" src="images\kaelos_schedule.png" style="margin-right: 1500px; position: absolute; left: 70px; top: 1300px; float: left; width: 240px;" /></a> <iq><strong>Shiftstoned:</strong><br />
        When you are <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/kaelosthereckoning" target="_blank">streaming</a>, do your viewers have any particular expectations about what types of decks they will see be seeing?</iq><br />
        <br />
        <span style="font-weight: bolder;">Kaelos:</span><br />
        They get pretty upset when I play anything approaching mainstream.&nbsp;<br />
        <br />
        Granted, that&rsquo;s probably why I have like ten viewers. After a year of <a href="https://kaelosthereckoning.com/analyses/models/card-models.php" target="_blank">modeling things</a>, making videos, creating new decks, and participating in tournaments.&nbsp;<br />
        <br />
        The &ldquo;undeterred by failure&rdquo; part is important because to find the really good stuff you have to either fail a lot or take ideas from other people.<br />
        <br />
        And the latter isn&rsquo;t really a challenge for me. My viewers get that, but it isn&rsquo;t what a lot of people want to see. They want to see someone crushing with a meta deck every night. Which I&rsquo;m capable of, but would bore me to tears.<br />
        <br />
        <iq><iq><span style="font-weight: bolder;">Shiftstoned:</span><br />
        How important is it to you that you win with your own brew?</iq><br style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255);" />
        <br style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255);" />
        <span style="font-weight: bolder; color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">Kaelos:</span><br />
        <span style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">Incredibly important. I don&rsquo;t play to win, I play for my wins to have worth.</span><br style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255);" />
        <br style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255);" />
        <span style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">I love my viewers, but I don&rsquo;t play for other people. I&rsquo;m always there to self-validate, not measure myself against others.</span><br />
        <br />
        <strong>Shiftstoned:</strong><br />
        What sort of reactions have you had from the <strong>Eternal</strong> community at large?</iq><br />
        <br />
        <span style="font-weight: bolder;">Kaelos:</span><br />
        This is kind of a difficult subject because the response is mainly disinterest or telling me what I can&rsquo;t do, and that I&rsquo;m not good enough.&nbsp;<br />
        <br />
        I&rsquo;ve had a few really constant and vocal supporters, and they mean more than I can say.&nbsp;<br />
        <br />
        Because without the support network this community gave me, I would never have recovered as much as I have&mdash;much less succeeded so well at a new game in the process of getting my brain back.<br />

        <em>Reprobates</em>&nbsp;is a <a href="https://eternalwarcry.com/tournaments/details/vj25s6HSknI/ecl-tuesday-weekly-top-8" target="_blank">tournament-winning</a> update to an earlier deck that you played in tbe <a href="https://eternalwarcry.com/tournaments/details/7JaLGz6WWMI/the-stranglecat-open-1-tribes-top-8" target="_blank">Stranglecat Open</a> during the <a href="https://www.direwolfdigital.com/news/eternal-the-dusk-road/" target="_blank"><strong>Dusk Road </strong></a>period.<br />
        <br />
        It&nbsp;seems to have gained a lot from the <strong><a href="https://www.direwolfdigital.com/news/chapter-19-the-fall-of-argenport/" target="_blank">Fall of Argenport</a>:</strong> <strong>Ixtun Merchant</strong>, <strpong>Jekk Lone Gun</strpong> and even ;<strong>Wyatt, Junk Collector</strong>are all new additions<br />
        <br />
       Notably you decided to include a nearly full contingent of <a href="https://www.direwolfdigital.com/news/winning-tactics/" target="_blank">Standards</a>, the new <strong>Power </strong>card type introduced with the latest expansion.<br />
        <br />
      We&#39;ve seen <a href="http://HighVoltage.html" target="_blank">other examples</a> of decks that take advantage of these <strong>Transmute</strong> effects.&nbsp;What do the&nbsp;<strong>Standards</strong> add to this list in particular?</iq><br />
       <br /> <strong>Kaelos:</strong><br />
        Without the <strong>Shugo Standards,</strong>&nbsp;I don&rsquo;t think this deck stands a chance competitively anymore.<br /><br />There are just too many <strong>Time</strong> fatties coming down left and right for my units to be capable of pushing through damage without <strong>Overwhelm&nbsp;</strong>or big combat tricks [ie: offensive&nbsp;<strong>Fast Spells</strong>]. And <strong>Shugo Tactic</strong> provides both.&nbsp;</pg><br />
        <a href="images/StonescarStandards.jpeg" target="_blank"><img alt="Image" src="images/StonescarStandards.jpeg" style="margin: 0px 30px 0px 315px; width: 842px; height: 383px;" /></a><pg>The <strong>Cabal Standard </strong>is also great when I&rsquo;m trying to cram in bodies and feel like I can&rsquo;t afford the space for <strong>Rapid Shot</strong>.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s not quite as good but it increases body density in the deck, which tops out at five power.&nbsp;<br />
        <br />
        So running lots of <strong>Standards</strong> is only an issue if I have too much <strong>Depleted</strong> power out of the gate.<br />
        <br />
        <h2g>Remember the cause</h2g><br />
        <iq><strong>Shiftstoned:</strong><br />
        Looking at the <strong>Influence Chart</strong>, there appear to be very low chances of drawing enough <strong>Influence</strong> to hit&nbsp;<img alt="Fire" src="../epc/icon-fire.png" style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255); width: 19px; height: 19px;" title="Justice" /><img alt="Fire" src="../epc/icon-fire.png" style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255); width: 19px; height: 19px;" title="Justice" />  and <img alt="Shadow" src="../epc/icon-shadow.png" style="width: 19px; height: 19px;" title="Justice" /><img alt="Shadow" src="../epc/icon-shadow.png" style="width: 19px; height: 19px;" title="Justice" /><img alt="Shadow" src="../epc/icon-shadow.png" style="width: 19px; height: 19px;" title="Justice" /> on curve.<br />
        <br />
        Is there some strategy that allows this to work despite the long odds for reaching those targets?</iq><br /><br /><img alt="Card Image" src="https://cards.eternalwarcry.com/cards/full/Common_Cause.png" style="position: absolute; left: 70px; top: 4200px; width: 250px; height: 397px;" /><strong>Kaelos:</strong><br />
        Can we be honest here? I was braindead and forgot to include <strong>Common Cause</strong>, which usually makes those odds a whole lot better in a tribal deck.<br />
        <br />
        <span style="font-weight: bolder; color: rgb(129, 195, 244);">Shiftstoned:&nbsp;</span><br style="color: rgb(129, 195, 244);" />
        <span style="color: rgb(129, 195, 244);">Hahaha, I&#39;m sure the readers will appreciate your honesty. And&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bolder;">Common Cause</span>&nbsp;does make a lot of sense here since all but one of the units are&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bolder;">Gunslingers</span>.</span><br />
        <br />
        <span style="color: rgb(129, 195, 244);">You happily remembered to include <strong>Common Cause</strong> in your previous version. How did this list handle differently without that <strong>Power</strong> card?</span><br />
        <br />
        <span style="font-weight: 700;">Kaelos:</span><span style="font-weight: bolder;">&nbsp;</span><br />
        I thought I was going to die nearly every game.<br />

        <h2g>Balance of power</h2g><br />        <strong style="color: rgb(129, 195, 244);">Shiftstoned:&nbsp;</strong><br />
        <font color="#81c3f4">Did you have any other thoughts when constructing the <strong>Power</strong> base for this list?</font><br />
        <br />
        <strong>Kaelos:</strong><br />
        The main consideration is balancing <strong>Power</strong> cards that perform neat tricks or support your deck in other ways versus getting enough <strong>non-depleted</strong> power to play things on curve...which is pretty essential for an <strong>Aggro</strong> deck.<br />
        <br />
        <img alt="Card Image" src="https://cards.eternalwarcry.com/cards/full/Cabal_Tactic.png" style="position: absolute; left: 70px; top: 5000px; width: 250px; height: 397px;" /> You can see when I run the variant of this list that has <strong>Rapid Shot</strong> rather than <strong>Wyatt</strong>, I&rsquo;ll take out the <strong>Cabal Standards</strong> completely just to increase my odds of activated <strong>Power</strong>.<br />
        <br />
        Even in the version that won the tournament, I went down to three <strong>Standards</strong> to increase my odds of activated power while preserving the odds of hitting one <strong>Cabal Tactic</strong> in the game. It takes about three of any given card for decent odds of hitting at least one in a game of typical length with this much draw.<br />
        <br />
        Lastly, you&rsquo;ll notice I didn&rsquo;t include any <strong>Seats</strong> to make up for all the other depleted &ldquo;added utility&rdquo; power I was running in the form of <strong>Standards</strong> and <strong>Crests</strong>.<br />
        <br />
        <span style="font-weight: bolder; color: rgb(129, 195, 244);">Shiftstoned:&nbsp;</span><br />
        <font color="#81c3f4">Yes, <strong>Seat of Chaos</strong> is noticeably absent...</font><br />
        <br />
        <span style="font-weight: bolder;">Kaelos:</span><br />
        I don&rsquo;t run <strong>Seats</strong> in <strong>Midrange Aggro</strong> decks unless I&rsquo;m really desperate for <strong>Influence</strong> out of the gate. Because they&rsquo;re typically useless after about <strong>Turn 3 or 4</strong> in terms of helping you play on curve. Whereas all the other power types retain utility or come in non-depleted.&nbsp;<br />
        <br />
        <iq><strong>Shiftstoned:&nbsp;</strong>The first time you brought this deck to a tournament, it was a limited <strong>Tribal</strong> format that required a minimum number of units to have the same type. What made you decide to stick with <strong>Gunslinger</strong> tribal for the the ECL event?</iq><br />
        <br />
        <strong>Kaelos:</strong><br />
        <strong>Slingers</strong> is just my go-to when I need to test myself or the meta rather than the deck.&nbsp;Because it&rsquo;s the deck that makes the most sense to my brain. I could pilot it in my sleep.<br />
        <br />
        This was the first tournament I&rsquo;d played to win since about a month or two prior when I made <a href="https://eternalwarcry.com/decks/details/5NC9AcsCZPY/oni-swarm" target="_blank"><strong>Top 8 </strong></a>in the <a href="https://rngeternal.com/ets/" target="_blank">Eternal Tournament Series </a>with the <em>Oni Swarm</em> deck. So I needed to get a good gauge of where my own play was.<br />
        <br />
        Compare that to a week later&hellip; we launched the <strong>Eternal Post</strong> that day and I may have gone for a celebratory drunkstream. I spend so much time testing unconventional decks and interactions, but <strong>Slingers</strong> is the deck that lets me test myself instead. <a href="images/UnusualSuspects.jpeg" style="background-color: rgb(23, 20, 29);" target="_blank"><img alt="Graphic" src="images\UnusualSuspects.jpeg" style="position: absolute; left: 100px; top: 200px; width: 250px; height: 164px;" /></a> </pg><font color="#81c3f4"> <img alt="Decklist" src="images\OniSwarmDecklist.jpeg" style="margin-right: 1500px; position: absolute; left: 70px; top: 6150px; float: left; width: 262px; height: 606px;" /> <h1g>Oni Swarm</h1g> <h2g><b>Subtitle goes here</b></h2g> <img alt="Influence Chart" src="images/OniSwarmComposed.jpeg" style="width: 840px; margin: 0px 70px 0px 315px;" title="Influence Chart" /> <pg><iq><strong>Shiftstoned:</strong>&nbsp;<br />
        More on the <strong>Eternal Post</strong> in a bit, but speaking of <em>Oni Swarm.</em>...By contrast, this list demonstrates what is possible for a mono color&nbsp;<strong>Power</strong> base: ninety percent or better to draw&nbsp;<img alt="Fire" src="../epc/icon-fire.png" style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255); width: 19px; height: 19px;" title="Justice" /></iq><img alt="Fire" src="../epc/icon-fire.png" style="width: 19px; height: 19px;" title="Justice" /><img alt="Fire" src="../epc/icon-fire.png" style="width: 19px; height: 19px;" title="Justice" />&nbsp;<span style="color: rgb(129, 195, 244);">by&nbsp;</span><strong style="color: rgb(129, 195, 244);">Turn 6</strong><span style="color: rgb(129, 195, 244);">!</span><br />
        <br />
        <span style="color: rgb(129, 195, 244);">Does it feel different to play a deck like this, where you can be so certain to hit your </span><strong style="color: rgb(129, 195, 244);">Influence</strong><span style="color: rgb(129, 195, 244);"> requirements when you need to?</span></pg></font><font color="#81c3f4"><pg><strong>Kaelos</strong><br />
        <div>
          It feels like &ldquo;Please, for the love of god give me another power or unit before my opponent can stabilize.&rdquo;</div>
        <div>
          <br />
          If <strong>Cull the Deck</strong> or <strong>Wisdom of the Elders</strong> was in <strong>Fire</strong>, I&rsquo;d be unstoppable.</div>
        <div>
          <br />
          I actually tried a variant of this with <strong>Oni Quartermaster.&nbsp;</strong> She&rsquo;s an <strong>Oni</strong>, we have weapons, draw is nice...<br />
          <br />
          But she&rsquo;s just such an easy target that she always draws silence or removal.&nbsp;And I&rsquo;d rather just have a lower cost, higher stat body post-silence.<br />
          <br />
          Or at least something that&rsquo;s enough of an immediate threat to warrant its likelihood of getting picked off by removal. She&rsquo;s a mid-late game payoff and that doesn&rsquo;t work in a deck like this.<br />
          <br />
          On the other hand, I built this deck originally as a challenge to make mono-<strong>Fire</strong> viable.&nbsp;And it was a pretty significant challenge at the time, when going into another color for even one or two key cards really strengthens most decks.<br />

          I thought about the <strong>Power</strong> base in that I knew I&rsquo;d only be able to play one color, so I had to make it count. The <strong>Kaleb&rsquo;s Favors</strong> were added just because I needed slightly more consistency making absolutely sure I could play my hand on-curve.<pg><br />
          But I didn&rsquo;t want to sacrifice more unit or weapon slots than I absolutely had to. And we wanted to get the extra two face damage rather than just subbing in more sigils.<br />
          <pg><iq><strong>Shiftstoned:</strong>&nbsp;<br />
          <strong>Granite Waystone</strong> x4 seems like a solid choice in a mono-<strong>Faction</strong> deck.</iq><br />
          <br />
          <strong>Kaelos:</strong><br />
          <div>
            There&rsquo;s no reason not to include a <strong>Power</strong> that comes in <strong>non-Depleted</strong> with a perk. Free chumps with no downside, if you&rsquo;re not looking for <strong>Seat</strong> activation.<br />
            <pg><iq><strong>Shiftstoned:</strong>&nbsp;<br />
            How much testing did you do with this deck before you decided to bring it to the <a href="https://rngeternal.com/ets/" target="_blank">Eternal Tournament Series</a>?</iq><br />
            <br />
            <strong>Kaelos:</strong><br />
            <div>
              Probably a month or two of playing it on stream sporadically. Hilariously, I submitted it on reddit about three days before the <a href="https://eternalwarcry.com/tournaments/details/UaEELBHck3Q/ets-2018-s3w1-top-8" target="_blank"><strong>Top 8 </strong></a>finish,&nbsp;and was told the list didn&rsquo;t work and couldn&rsquo;t be played in a <strong>Hailstorm</strong> meta.</div>
            <div>
              <pg><iq><strong>Shiftstoned:</strong>&nbsp;<br />
              What was the response when you finished in the <strong>Top 8</strong> with this deck? </iq><br />
              <br />
              <strong>Kaelos:</strong><br />
              <div>
                Mainly quite positive. A lot of people who&rsquo;d followed my jank for a while were pleased to see that when I succeeded, it was on my own terms.<br />
                <br />
                At the time the meta for weeks had been decks going over the top of each other for the slowest, biggest win cons. People were so pleased to see a mono <strong>Fire</strong> deck, and an <strong>Aggro</strong> deck, that still <em>worked.</em><br />

                  <iq>You seem to have many <strong>Eternal</strong>-related interests that go beyond just ranking up.<br />
                  <br />
                  Can you describe what motivates you to stream every day.</iq><br />
                  <br />
                  <strong>Kaelos:</strong><br />
                  <div>
                    The people. Dear god, I love the people.<br />
                    <br />
                    My viewers are amazing human beings who keep me dragging myself out of bed on days it takes 2 hours to get dressed. Because they make me laugh and smile and cheer me on, even when I lose. So I know it&rsquo;ll always be worth the effort.<br />
                    <br />
                    I would care about my numbers a lot more if the people who stopped by weren&rsquo;t so consistently awesome.<br />
                    <br />
                    <iq><strong>Shiftstoned:</strong>&nbsp;<br />
                    What about competing in tournaments?</iq><br />
                    <br />
                    <strong>Kaelos:</strong><br />
                    <div>
                      You&rsquo;d never know it by my record, but I&rsquo;m a fairly competitive person&mdash;just not in the usual sense.<br />
                      <br />
                      Tournaments are probably my favorite format of play, simply because forcing your perception to wrap around another person&rsquo;s brain and behavior so that you can predict them always teaches me something new.<br />
                      <br />
                      That&rsquo;s something you get a lot less of in ranked. Because you don&rsquo;t see the list ahead of time. And you don&rsquo;t know the pilot. So you have to play reactively to some degree, rather than with foresight.<br />
                      <br />
                      <iq><strong>Shiftstoned:</strong>&nbsp;<br />
                      You also have invested a lot of energy in a detailed data analysis of <strong>Eternal&#39;s</strong> card set.</iq><br />
                      <br />
                      <strong>Kaelos:</strong><br />
                      <div>
                        <p>
                          I can&rsquo;t help sciencing. I go nuts without it because I want to know how everything works.</p>
                        <p>
                          And if I&rsquo;m going to the trouble, I may as well write it down in case other people are curious too.</p>
                        <p>
                          <br />
                          Numbers are just one more way to validate patterns that I see in decks, cards, or game mechanics.<br />

                          For those who haven&#39;t joined yet, what happens on the <a href="https://discordapp.com/invite/xGHfW2t" target="_blank"><strong>Kaelos the Reckoning</strong> discord server?</a></iq><br />
                          <br />
                          <strong>Kaelos:</strong></p>
                        <div>
                          I&rsquo;m mainly there for the #kidsfallingover channel. Please don&rsquo;t tell anyone.<br />
                          <br />
                          In all honesty, I just wanted a place where people could ask questions, exchange ideas, and support one another&rsquo;s competitive play or content where I could freely evict people whose behavior suppressed that. Negativity toward other players has no place there.<br />
                          <br />
                          We have a rule that there are no &ldquo;bad cards&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s fine to say that a card does poorly in certain match-ups, metas, decks, or for specific purposes. But it&rsquo;s not cool to tell someone a card, deck, or idea they&rsquo;re playing around with is worthless.<br />
                          <br />
                          Because it&rsquo;s equivalent to telling someone their effort and curiosity is worthless. That suppresses the innovation that keeps ladder from getting stale and keeps the game interesting and worth playing. Not to mention: making assumptions or assertions without testing is just bad science.<br />

                          <strong>Shiftstoned:</strong>&nbsp;<br />
                          As if all that wasn&#39;t enough, you&#39;ve just recently launching the <strong>Eternal Post</strong>. Congratulations! What inspired you to create this new space for content?</iq><br />
                          <br />
                          <strong>Kaelos:</strong><br />
                          <div>
                            In <strong>Eternal </strong>right now, most of the content is produced by teams&mdash;and it&rsquo;s hard to get any kind of name recognition or have your content seen if you&rsquo;re not attached to or picked up by one of those groups.<br />
                            <br />
                            That was the case for me because nobody wants someone who doesn&rsquo;t play to win. But I was fortunate enough to have many of the top-level players as stream viewers (for deck ideas) who became friends and advocates anyway.<br />
                            <br />
                            Once I had any kind of pull to help other people get seen, it seemed right to help them avoid the obstacles I had to circumvent. I already had a website, so I figured I could just expand it to include sections where other people could be seen.<br />
                            <br />
                            And there was a lot more interest than I anticipated. So I said &quot;Screw it! Let&rsquo;s make it a content site where I post rather than my site where content is posted&quot;.<br />
                            <br />
                            <iq><strong>Shiftstoned:</strong>&nbsp;<br />
                            Can you describe <strong>Eternal Post</strong> for the readers?</iq><br />
                            <br />
                            <strong>Kaelos:</strong><br />
                            <div>
                              We&rsquo;ve got a lot of big names on board (who should really be commended for their participation). Articles will be posted right beside people who are totally unknown to help get those people visibility and name recognition without the necessity of being part of some other group.<br />
                              <br />
                              Provided the content is good and the person can behave civilly to other human beings, I will put literally anyone&rsquo;s stuff on the site. Hopefully, this will lead to a place where content truly succeeds on its own merit, rather than requiring name recognition or popularity for visibility.<br />
                              <br />
                              I think if we can pull it off, it will be an incredibly healthy thing for the <strong>Eternal</strong> community and help drive the player base to be more inclusive, accessible, and approachable for new players.<br />
                              <br />
                              That&rsquo;s the change I want to see, so I feel obliged to work at making it happen.<br />

                              Thank you for your time Kaelos. You have really shared a lot of insightful information here. But we&#39;ve saved the most important question for the end.<br />

                              I know that the readers are dying to hear it from you: will there ever be a <strong>Tier 1</strong> deck that contains <strong>The Last Word</strong>?</iq><br />
