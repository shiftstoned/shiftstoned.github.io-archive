            <h1g>About the Eternal Power Calculator</h1g>

            You will gain a competitive edge in <b>Eternal</b> by maximizing the chances of playing your cards on curve. <br>
            <br>Getting under the hood and optimizing your deck's power base is
            the best way to ensure that you can play the cards you want, when you
            want to play them. <br>
            <br>
            The <b>Eternal Power Calculator</b> is a deck-building tool that
            visualizes your odds of drawing enough<b> Influence</b> and <b>Power</b>
            based specifically on the cards found in your deck.

            <h1g>How it works</h1g>

            Import a deck and the visualizer will display a graph showing the
            probability of meeting specific <strong>Influence</strong>
            requirements over a set number of turns. The first column represents
            your opening hand when going first.

            <h1g><a name="chart" id="chart"></a>Charting
              Influence</h1g>
          </pg>


            <center><img src="../guide/images/ExampleJ.png" margin-bottom="0" margin-left="50o" width="800"></center>

            <pg>
            In this example you can see that on Turn 2 you have a better than
            90% chance of drawing the right <b>Influence</b> to play any card
            with a cost of <img  src="../icon-justice.png" alt="Justice" title="Justice" style="width: 19px; height: 19px;">, namely <em><b>Vanquish</b></em>.
            Follow the curve to see that your chances only increase with each
            additional draw. <h2g>But what if you want to play <strong><em>Valkyrie
                  Enforcer</em></strong> on <strong>Turn 3</strong>?</h2g> </pg>
          <center><img src="../guide/images/ExampleJJ.png" margin-bottom="0" width="800"></center>
          <pg><br>
            <img src="../icon-justice.png" alt="Justice" title="Justice" style="width: 19px; height: 19px;"><img src="../icon-justice.png" alt="Justice" title="Justice" style="width: 19px; height: 19px;">
            is a higher Influence cost, so your chances decrease. <br>
            <br>
            Fortunately this deck builder (2017 ETS World Champion camat0) has
            included enough <strong>Justice</strong> sources in his power base
            that the odds are still pretty good - nearly 80%.
            <h1g><a name="draws" id="draws"></a>Draws vs. Turns</h1g>
            Here the chart tells us that after 7 turns our odds of hitting <img src="../icon-fire.png" alt="Fire" title="Fire" style="width: 19px; height: 19px;"><img src="../icon-fire.png" alt="Fire" title="Fire" style="width: 19px; height: 19px;"><img src="../icon-fire.png" alt="Fire" title="Fire" style="width: 19px; height: 19px;"> to
            play <em>Icaria, the Liberator</em> are potentially as low as 70%.</pg>
          <center><img src="../guide/images/ExampleJJJFFF.png" width="800"></center>
          <pg> However - assuming you will play at least one aditional draw card such as <strong>Quarry</strong> before Turn 7 - your
            chances of meeting Icaria’s steep <img src="../icon-fire.png" alt="Fire"

              title="Fire" style="width: 19px; height: 19px;"><img src="../icon-fire.png"

              src="../icon-justice.png" alt="Justice" title="Justice" style="width: 19px; height: 19px;">
            requirements improve, as represented by columns 8 or 9. <br>
            <br>
            Beyond the first turn, most decks include additional card draw. Even
            though we might speak of wanting to play <em><strong>Harsh Rule</strong></em>
            “on Turn 4 or 5,” what we are really saying is “4 or 5 draws beyond our
            opening hand.” <br>
            <br>
            This becomes even more important as the game goes on. You draw at
            least one card per turn of course. But ideally you will also draw some
            extra cards along the way.<br>
            <br>
            When using the <strong>Eternal Power Calculator</strong>, it helps to
            get in the habit of thinking of number of draws rather than number of
            turns. <h1g><a name="table" id="table"></a>Power Odds Table</h1g>
            <strong>Influence</strong> is only one of two costs in Eternal that are associated with
            playing your cards. To see the whole picture, we must also consider <strong>
              Power.</strong> <br>
            <br>
            For simplicity, we generally assume that at least one <strong>Power</strong>
            card will be drawn for each turn, and our <strong>Maximum Power</strong>
            will increase at a consistent rate. <br>
            <br>
            Realistically, however - that only happens when luck is on our side.
            It is often just as true that we will miss a <strong>Power</strong>
            drop and not be able to play <em><strong>Sandstorm Titan </strong></em>until
            Turn 5 or later. <br>
            <br>
            Deck-builders are constantly asking themselves questions such as,
            “Have I included enough power to reliably cast <em><strong>Channel
                the Tempest</strong></em> when I want to?” <br>
            <br>
            The <strong>Power Odds Table</strong> removes the guesswork by
            factoring in both <strong>Power</strong> and <strong>Influence</strong>
            costs for every card in your deck. This includes neutral cards such
            as <em><strong>Seek Power </strong></em>or the <em><strong>Strangers</strong></em>.
            It even accounts for <strong>Ultimates</strong>, Champion thresholds and other abilities
            that have a cost associated with them.&nbsp; </pg>
          <center><img src="../guide/images/OddsTable.jpeg" width="800"></center>
          <pg> <h1g><a name="not" id="not"></a>What is <em>not</em> accounted
              for?</h1g> The probabilities displayed by the <strong>Eternal Power
              Calculator</strong> are quite accurate and will help you gain a
            better understanding of your deck. But for the sake of simplification,
            a couple of factors are not accounted for mathematically: mulligans
            and prerequisites. <br>
            <br>
            These two factors influence the probabilities in different ways, and
            when combined they come close to balancing each other out - so the net
            result is minimal. -->

            <!-- If you are interested to learn more, check out the <a href="expanded.html" target="_blank">expanded topic</a>. -->


            <h1g>The Mulligan Phase</h1g> Deciding whether or
            not to keep your opening hand is a strategic decision in <strong>Eternal</strong>.
            If you choose to re-draw, your starting hand is guaranteed to include
            either 2, 3 or 4 power cards (with an equal chance of each). <br>
            <br>
            This raises your chances of having more <strong>Influence</strong> to
            start with - so (generally speaking) your odds may be ever-so-slightly
            higher than what is actually depicted on the charts in the <strong>Eternal
              Power Calculator</strong>.

            <h1g>Pre-requisites</h1g>
            On the other
            hand, some power sources have a <strong>Power </strong>cost
            associated with them. <em><strong>Seek Power </strong></em>and the
            five <em><strong>Favors</strong></em> are the most obvious examples.
            <br>
            <br>
            The <strong>Eternal Power Calculator</strong> considers any card that
            increases your <strong> Power</strong> to be a <strong>Power</strong>
            source when determining probabilities. But it does not consider the
            sequence in which cards are played.<br>
            <br>
            In other words, including <em><strong>Vara's Favor</strong></em> in
            your deck will increase the overall chances of reaching your desired<strong>
              Shadow Influence</strong> costs. But because it can not be played
            until Turn 2,&nbsp; if you draw <em><strong>Vara's Favor </strong></em><strong></strong>instead
            of a <strong>Power </strong>card your true odds of achieving <img src="../icon-shadow.png"

              alt="Shadow" title="Shadow" style="width: 19px; height: 19px;"> on <strong>Turn
              1</strong> will be ever-so-slightly lower than what is represented
            on the charts.
